        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Adesina Semiu Ademola. I am a graduate of the University of
          Ibadan, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Pharmacy. My academic
          journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in healthcare and the
          science behind medications, allowing me to contribute effectively in
          the pharmaceutical industry. Beyond my professional background in
          Pharmacy, I have a deep-seated passion for software engineering. My
          interest in technology drives me to explore the intricacies of coding,
          software development, and the ever-evolving digital landscape.
          Currently, I am expanding my knowledge and skills by studying at
          AltSchool Africa, where I am delving into various aspects of software
          engineering. I am eager to integrate my expertise in healthcare with
          technology to create innovative solutions that can impact lives
          positively. In my spare time, I enjoy meeting new people, exchanging
          ideas, and exploring new ways to contribute to the development of a
          better society. I genuinely believe in the vision of a new Nigeria and
          am committed to being a part of the change.
